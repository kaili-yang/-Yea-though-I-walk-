This is a story of my best old friend, L.H. When she was young, she worked for [ISMC](https://ismc.ca/about). She is normal but doing great amzing things for her whole life, offering countless help to international students like me in Canada. I couldn't imagin how my life would be tough and lonely without her kind aids at the very beginning in Canada . Now she is over 80 but still help students to get adjust to their new lives here (with her low pension).

This is her autobiography book📖. She self-published it.  I was deeply touched by her legendary experience and pure spirit. That's why I make it public and translate it into Chinese hope it inspires more people.💗
